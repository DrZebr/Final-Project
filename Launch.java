// Once the countown reaches 0, the rocket should launch for a set numbers of seconds depending on how much fuel is in the rocket. As the rocket burns fuel it should be gaining altitude. Because Delta V is hard to calculate, just assume that one pound of fuel burned in one second will increase your speed by 30 meters per second. One pound of fuel burned in two seconds will increase  your speed by 15 meters per second. Furthermore, two pounds of fuel burned in one seccond will increase your speed by 60 meter per second.
// Once the rocket has run out of fuel, the rocket should enter freefall. Astronauts should be able to do an EVA for 5 minutes while the rocket hurdles into free space reducing speed at 9.81 meters per second and then gaining speed at a rate of 9.81 per second until it comes back into the atmosphere. The ship will burn up if it ends up going faster than 3,000 meters per seconds in the atmosphere, so take this into account. The atmosphere "ends" at 70,000 meters.
// Once the ship falls below 10,000 meters, the parachutes should deploy, reducing the speed to a total speed of no faster than 7 meters per second.
// Once the ship has landed safely, the door should open and astronauts should be directed to get out.
